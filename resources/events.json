Writing documentation is a great way to give back to the open source community and build your Ruby skills and fundamentals.\n\nThis talk will teach you the value of open-source, the benefits of contributing, and a little bit about how ruby-core works. You will learn what to look for when spotting documentation bugs in the MRI source code. We will cover the guidelines to writing MRI documentation, and how to submit a patch.\n\nZachary Scott has been a Ruby committer since last Fall and will share his experiences with the standard library of MRI.","code":"S09","id":63,"kind":"session","language":"English","position":2,"title":"Contributing to Ruby","title_en":"Contributing to Ruby","speakers":[{"abstract":"Vermont native, with strong family values, and a big heart.","abstract_en":"Vermont native, with strong family values, and a big heart.","code":null,"id":60,"location":null,"name":"Zachary Scott","name_en":"Zachary Scott","organizations":[{"id":39,"name":"MRI Committer","name_en":"MRI Committer"}],"socials":[{"avatar":null,"user_name":"zzak","social_name":"Github"},{"avatar":null,"user_name":"_zzak","social_name":"Twitter"},{"avatar":"7fe945668a4fc098e886e20dea71d2ee","user_name":null,"social_name":"Gravatar"}]}],"sessions":[]},{"abstract":null,"abstract_en":null,"code":null,"id":67,"kind":"info","language":null,"position":1,"title":"(Hall B will start at 10:30am today)","title_en":"(Hall B will start at 10:30am today)","speakers":[],"sessions":[]},{"abstract":null,"abstract_en":null,"code":null,"id":65,"kind":"info","language":null,"position":1,"title":"CLOSING","title_en":"CLOSING","speakers":[],"sessions":[]},{"abstract":null,"abstract_en":null,"code":null,"id":66,"kind":"info","language":null,"position":1,"title":"Door Open","title_en":"Door Open","speakers":[],"sessions":[]},{"abstract":null,"abstract_en":null,"code":null,"id":75,"kind":"break","language":null,"position":1,"title":"COFFEE BREAK","title_en":"COFFEE BREAK","speakers":[],"sessions":[]},{"abstract":null,"abstract_en":null,"code":null,"id":78,"kind":"info","language":null,"position":1,"title":"CLOSING","title_en":"CLOSING","speakers":[],"sessions":[]},{"abstract":"The robotics revolution has already begun.

You'll find out about the finer pieces of its inner workings and you might take home a few tricks that evolved while developing the native extensions that sit at the very heart of krypt. \n\nWith its recent integration into JRuby, you might already be using krypt with JRuby right now without even knowing. Learn about the details and how krypt is used to simulate OpenSSL features that were not available in JRuby before. Find out more about how it can help making Ruby a safer place. How it can help solving nasty problems such as signing our beloved gems for example.\n \nkrypt tries to ultimately replace the OpenSSL extension in the Ruby standard library, and with our combined effort we could actually steer the story of Ruby cryptography towards a happy ending.\n\nFind out how!","code":"S29","id":41,"kind":"session","language":"English","position":1,"title":"krypt. semper pi.","title_en":"krypt. semper pi.","speakers":[{"abstract":"Martin is a member of ruby-core, one of the maintainers of the Ruby OpenSSL extension and the author of krypt.

Because we're curious about it, that's why.","code":"S26","id":68,"kind":"session","language":"English","position":2,"title":"From Rails to the web server to the browser","title_en":"From Rails to the web server to the browser","speakers":[{"abstract":"David Padilla is CEO at Crowd Interactive, a leader Ruby on Rails consultancy based in Mexico.\n\nHe's usually trying out all the new technologies that come out everyday, and, sometimes, just knowing how to use them is not enough, so, he spends a lot of his free time reading other people's code.\n\nThrough his career, he has been devoted to promoting the Ruby on Rails community in Mexico through rails.mx and the organization of the only Ruby conference in the area: Magma Conf.\n\n","abstract_en":"David Padilla is CEO at Crowd Interactive, a leader Ruby on Rails consultancy based in Mexico.\n\nHe's usually trying out all the new technologies that come out everyday, and, sometimes, just knowing how to use them is not enough, so, he spends a lot of his free time reading other people's code.\n\nThrough his career, he has been devoted to promoting the Ruby on Rails community in Mexico through rails.mx and the organization of the only Ruby conference in the area: Magma Conf.\n\n","code":null,"id":52,"location":"Colima, Mexico","name":"David Padilla","name_en":"David Padilla","organizations":[{"id":33,"name":"Crowd Interactive / CEO","name_en":"Crowd Interactive / CEO"}],"socials":[{"avatar":null,"user_name":"dabit","social_name":"Github"},{"avatar":null,"user_name":"dabit","social_name":"Twitter"},{"avatar":"a59cda5de705716cbd18195a4dd68a56","user_name":null,"social_name":"Gravatar"}]}],"sessions":[]}]},{"end_at":"2013-06-01T03:00:00Z","id":53,"start_at":"2013-06-01T02:00:00Z","sessions":[{"abstract":"Rails Gem\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bRESTful\u30e2\u30c7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\n\nDevise\u3084Kaminari\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u5b9a\u756a\u306eRails Gem\u306b\u306f\u3001\u5b9f\u306fRESTful\u306a\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30e2\u30c7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u96a0\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u3064\u307e\u308a\u3001\u305d\u306eGem\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3088\u3044\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u8a2d\u8a08\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\nRails\u306f2.0\u4ee5\u6765RESTful\u306a\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u3066\u9032\u5316\u3057\u3066\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3064\u307e\u308a\u305d\u308c\u306f\u3001RESTful\u304c\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4e00\u90e8\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u610f\u5473\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002routes.rb\u306eresources\u306f\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u4ee3\u8868\u4f8b\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u5fdc\u7528\u7684\u306a\u5834\u9762\u3067\u306fRESTful\u306a\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u3042\u307e\u308a\u7528\u610f\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u3001\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u958b\u767a\u3067\u306f\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u8ff7\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3082\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u305d\u308c\u3092\u88dc\u3046\u306e\u304cGem\u306e\u5b58\u5728\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\nGem\u306b\u63a1\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5b9f\u8df5\u7684\u3067\u6709\u7528\u306a\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u898b\u3066\u3044\u304d\u3001\u3055\u3089\u306b\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9\u3068\u305d\u308c\u3092\u57cb\u3081\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u306eGem\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\n","abstract_en":"To Be Announced","code":"S78","id":69,"kind":"session","language":"Japanese","position":1,"title":"Rails Gems realize RESTful modeling patterns","title_en":"Rails Gems realize RESTful modeling patterns","speakers":[{"abstract":"A RESTafarian\nOne of the organizers of Sendagaya.rb\nHeld the \"Study meeting of the RESTful URL design on Rails\"\n(\u300cRails\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bRESTful\u306aURL\u8a2d\u8a08\u52c9\u5f37\u4f1a\u300d)","abstract_en":"A RESTafarian\nOne of the organizers of Sendagaya.rb\nHeld the \"Study meeting of the RESTful URL design on Rails\"\n(\u300cRails\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bRESTful\u306aURL\u8a2d\u8a08\u52c9\u5f37\u4f1a\u300d)","code":null,"id":53,"location":"Fuchu-shi Tokyo, Japan","name":"Toru Kawamura","name_en":"Toru Kawamura","organizations":[{"id":34,"name":"Freelancer","name_en":"Freelancer"}],"socials":[{"avatar":null,"user_name":"tkawa","social_name":"Github"},{"avatar":null,"user_name":"tkawa","social_name":"Twitter"},{"avatar":"4bc8a6fb46ecbd1a5432e58225954ea3","user_name":null,"social_name":"Gravatar"}]}],"sessions":[]},{"abstract":"Origami and the Ruby programming language have a lot more in common than having Japanese roots.
