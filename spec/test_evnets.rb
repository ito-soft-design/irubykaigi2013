Overall, I've been developing software and delivering projects since the early 90's. You can find me at Twitter (@akitaonrails) or read my blog (http://www.akitaonrails.com), though most of my content is in Brazilian Portuguese.","code":"18S06:1","id":52,"name":"\u79cb\u7530\u30d5\u30a1\u30d3\u30aa\u8aa0","name_en":"Fabio Akita","organizations":[{"code":null,"created_at":"2013-04-23T11:52:56Z","id":48,"name":"Gonow Tecnologia","name_en":null,"updated_at":"2013-04-23T11:52:56Z"}]}],"sessions":[]},{"abstract":null,"abstract_en":null,"code":"2011-07-18:M:break:2","id":131,"kind":"break","position":46,"title":"\u4f11\u61a9","title_en":"Break","speakers":[],"sessions":[]},{"abstract":null,"abstract_en":null,"code":"2011-07-18:S:break:2","id":132,"kind":"break","position":46,"title":"\u4f11\u61a9","title_en":"Break","speakers":[],"sessions":[]},{"abstract":"Ruby on Rails\u30db\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3067\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u308bEngine Yard\u793e\u3067 \u50cd\u304f\u8a71\u8005\u304c\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u5916\u3067\u50cd\u304f\u4e8b\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3001\u8a00\u8449\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u306e\u9762\u3001\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u63b4\u307f\u65b9\u306a\u3069\u3001\u7d4c\u9a13\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u3066\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002","abstract_en":"What does it take to work as a Ruby engineer outside of Japan?

Recently, MacRuby has become viable as a tool for developing useful desktop applications for Mac OS X.\nHowever, as of March 2011, MacRuby is still missing some functionality that is present in cRuby. Therefore, MacRuby is not able to run Ruby on Rails.\nIn my presentation, I will explain how I modified MacRuby to make it a suitable foundation for running Rails. I would also like to explain some of technical intricacies that I discovered along the way.","code":"17S08","id":88,"kind":"session","position":35,"title":"MacRuby on Rails \u301cMacRuby\u304b\u3089\u898b\u305fcRuby\u301c","title_en":"MacRuby on Rails","speakers":[{"abstract":"MRI\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u4e00\u4eba\u3002\u62c5\u5f53\u306fReadline\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u3067\u3059\u3002","abstract_en":"Kouji Takao is one of the commiter of MRI.\nHe is maintener of Readline of Ruby.","code":"17S08:1","id":32,"name":"\u9ad8\u5c3e\u5b8f\u6cbb","name_en":"Kouji Takao","organizations":[{"code":null,"created_at":"2013-04-23T11:52:51Z","id":31,"name":"\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u5fdc\u7528\u901a\u4fe1\u7814\u7a76\u6240","name_en":null,"updated_at":"2013-04-23T11:52:51Z"}]}],"sessions":[]}]},{"created_at":"2013-04-23T11:52:52Z","end_at":"2011-07-17T07:10:00Z","id":41,"place_area_id":1,"start_at":"2011-07-17T06:40:00Z","updated_at":"2013-04-23T11:52:52Z","sessions":[{"abstract":null,"abstract_en":null,"code":"2011-07-17:S:break:3","id":92,"kind":"break","position":35,"title":"\u4f11\u61a9","title_en":"Break","speakers":[],"sessions":[]}]},{"created_at":"2013-04-23T11:52:52Z","end_at":"2011-07-17T08:10:00Z","id":43,"place_area_id":1,"start_at":"2011-07-17T07:10:00Z","updated_at":"2013-04-23T11:52:52Z","sessions":[{"abstract":"\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u306b\u3088\u308a\uff0cRuby \u306f \u591a\u5927\u306a\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u67d4\u8edf\u6027\u3092\u7372\u5f97\u3057\u305f\uff0e\n\u3057\u304b\u3057\uff0c\u3053\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308a\u540c\u540d\u306e\u30e1\u30bd\u30c3\u30c9\u304c\u885d\u7a81\u3059\u308b\u5371\u967a\u6027\u3082\u5b55\u3093\u3067\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\uff0e\n\u3053\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\uff0cClassboxes \u3084 Refinements \u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304c\uff0c\u3053\u308c\u3089\u306b\u306f\u554f\u984c\u3084\u5236\u9650\u304c\u6709\u308b\uff0e\n\u3053\u306e\u767a\u8868\u3067\u306f\uff0c\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u3042\u308b \"Method Shelters\" \u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3057\uff0c\n\u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3068\u306e\u5dee\u7570\u3092\u8ff0\u3079\u308b\uff0e","abstract_en":"\"Open Class\" instroduces\nhuge flexibility into Ruby, but it also introducse risk of class\nextension conflicts.\nTo address this problem, some module systems including Classboxes and\nRefinements were proposed.\nHowever, these existing systems have some problems or limitations.\nThis presentation proposes new module system named \"Method Shelters\" and\nshows difference between Method Shelters and other systems.","code":"17S09","id":94,"kind":"session","position":35,"title":"Method Shelters : Classboxes \u3067\u3082 Refinements \u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044\u5225\u306e\u3084\u308a\u65b9","title_en":"Method Shelters : Another Way to Resolve Class Extension Conflicts","speakers":[{"abstract":"\u3057\u304c\u306a\u3044\u535a\u58eb\u8ab2\u7a0b\u306e\u5b66\u751f\uff0e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u8a00\u8a9e\u3068\u304b\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u5316\u3068\u304b\u3092\u7814\u7a76\uff0e","abstract_en":"Ph.D. student in Dept. of Mathematical and Computing Sciences at Tokyo Institute of Technology","code":"17S09:1","id":37,"name":"\u8d64\u4e95\u99ff\u5e73","name_en":"Shumpei Akai","organizations":[{"code":null,"created_at":"2013-04-23T11:52:52Z","id":34,"name":"\u6771\u4eac\u5de5\u696d\u5927\u5b66","name_en":null,"updated_at":"2013-04-23T11:52:52Z"}]}],"sessions":[]},{"abstract":"Ruby 1.9\u3067\u306f\u30cd\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u63a1\u7528\u3068\u305d\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9ad8\u901f\u5316\u304c\u55a7\u4f1d\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304d\u305f\u304c\u3001\n\u5834\u5408\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u306f\u6709\u52b9\u306b\u52d5\u304b\u306a\u3044\u6642\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\n\u307e\u305f Core i7\u7b49\u306e\u8fd1\u5e74\u306eCPU\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u7279\u6027\u3068\u76f8\u6027\u306e\u60aa\u3044\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u63a1\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u7b87\u6240\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\n\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u8cb7\u3046\u3068\u60b2\u3057\u3044\u601d\u3044\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3046\u308b\u3002\n\u672c\u767a\u8868\u3067\u306f\u3001CRuby\u306eGVL(Global VM Lock)\u3068Mutex.lock \u30e1\u30bd\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u554f\u984c\u70b9\u3001\u304a\u3088\u3073\u6539\u5584\u6848\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308b","abstract_en":"Many people believe Ruby 1.9 is faster than 1.8.\nBut it's not always true.
